#### Code for Jazz Guitar Voice-Leading Chord Fingerings with Long Short-Term Memory paper

All files in the data directory have main methods and can be executed individually. Some need to be executed separately to perform their task.

The MAIN LSTM file is 'LstmModel.py', which contains the actual model we publish. Run this code with 'python3 lstm/LstmModel.py'.

A few files in the LSTM directory are not used in the final model. They are there for potential future work or to document past work. They all have a comment in the first couple of lines that says something similar to 'NOTE: this is not included in the model' to mark that they are unused.
